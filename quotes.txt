I need a machine gun
There is something you could do for me, Doctor.
I can't wait to show you my toys.
What? Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya. I'm just gonna hurt ya... really, really bad.
Oh. We have got company.
Ooh, come to Daddy.
Are you sweet talkin' me?
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah. Blah-blah, blah, blah. All of that chitchat's gonna get ya hurt.
You left me in a black hole of rage and confusion.
Would you die for me?
I Am Not Someone Who Is Loved. I'm An Idea. A State Of Mind.
You Know What? Sometimes Hurt Happens.
You helped me by erasing my mind.
Listen, you are my gift to this handsome hunka hunka! You belong to him now.
Are you sweet talkin' me? All'a that chitchat's gonna getcha hurt...
Hello, baby!
Ah, if you weren't so crazy, I'd think you were insane. Go... away.
Bring the car around. We're going for a drive.
Oh, you know I'd do anything for you. By the way, I've got some grape soda on ice and a bear skin rug waiting.
